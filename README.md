# An ode to the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit...

    Once upon a time, there were a bunch of experts sitting at a table,
    talking among themselves as to what awesome thing they were likely
    to (build/do) next.

    Then, a voice from the crowd of these like minded geniuses emerged… 
    “What if we make a tool that can automatically install Windows? Like, over the network?”

    Ever since that day...?
    Well, the world’s best software engineers put their heads together...
    ...and made a series of service and software suites…
    
    (Windows Deployment Services/WDS): When you need an (image file/ISO), and no funny business.
    (Microsoft Deployment Toolkit/MDT): When you need to be seen as an adult, not a child.
    (System Center Configuration Manager/SCCM): The end all, be all... of system configurations. 
    (Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit/WinADK): When you feel like whittling away at the build process.
    (Windows Preinstallation Environment/WinPE): When all else fails, this is the last line of defense.

    Now, there are various other names and pieces of software that COULD go along with this process... 
    There’s Hyper-V, Internet Information Services, Background Intelligent Transfer Service... 
    In the end, everything ties right back to… The Microsoft Deployment Toolkit.
    
    These geniuses, assembled a toolkit like no other.
    With it, you can install Windows like a pro. 
    There used to be a day and age where people had a hard time transferring all of their stuff around.
    
    Not anymore. 
    With the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit, and Active Directory Domain Services…? 
    You can really show people who the boss is, and keep it all moving and flowing nicely. 

    Some people might even stop and ask you, “Hey, how do you keep things moving so smoothly like that…?”
    Your response will be... *pulling your shades down slightly* “I simply learned from the best…”

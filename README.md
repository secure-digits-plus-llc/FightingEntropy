# An ode to the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit...

    Once upon a time, there were a bunch of experts sitting at a table, <br>
    talking among themselves as to what awesome thing they were likely <br>
    to (build/do) next.

    Then, a voice from the crowd of these like minded geniuses emerged… <br>
    “What if we make a tool that can automatically install Windows? Like, <br>
    over the network?”

    Ever since that day...? <br>
    Well, the world’s best software engineers put their heads together... <br>
    ...and made a series of service and software suites… <br>
    (Windows Deployment Services/WDS): <br>
    - When you need an (image file/ISO), and no funny business. <br>
    (Microsoft Deployment Toolkit/MDT): <br>
    - When you need to be seen as an adult, not a child. <br>
    (System Center Configuration Manager/SCCM): <br>
    - The end all, be all... of system configurations. <br>
    (Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit/WinADK): <br>
    - When you feel like whittling away at the build process. <br>
    (Windows Preinstallation Environment/WinPE): <br>
    - When all else fails, this is the last line of defense. <br>

    Now, there are various other names and pieces of software that COULD go <br>
    along with this process... there’s Hyper-V, Internet Information Services, <br>
    Background Intelligent Transfer Service, but in the end, everything ties <br>
    right back to… The Microsoft Deployment Toolkit.<br>
    
    These geniuses, assembled a toolkit like no other. <br>
    With it, you can install Windows like a pro. <br>
    There used to be a day and age where people had a hard time <br>
    transferring all of their stuff around. <br>
    
    Not anymore. <br>
    With the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit, and Active Directory Domain Services…? <br>
    You can really show people who the boss is, and keep it moving and flowing nicely. <br>

    Some people might even stop and ask you, <br>
    “Hey, how do you keep things moving so smoothly like that…?” <br> 
    Your response will be... *pull your shades down slightly* <br>
    “I simply learned from the best…”

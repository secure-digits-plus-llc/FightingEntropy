# An ode to the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit...

    It is *the* toolkit...
    ...that Microsoft themselves uses...
    ...to deploy *additional* toolkits.

    It's not that weird.
    You're just thinking way too far into it, honestly.

    Regardless... it is quite a fearsome toolkit to have in one's pocket.
    Or, wherever really...
    ...at any given time.

    When you need to be taken seriously...?
    Well, it *should* be the first choice on one's agenda.
    But, that's up to you.

    The [Microsoft Deployment Toolkit].
    Even Mr. Gates thinks it's awesome.
